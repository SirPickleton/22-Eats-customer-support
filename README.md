# Cosc 310 Individual Project - Additions Post A3

For this project, I've taken the code that my group had worked on and expanded on it by adding 2 new systems in the form of APIs. The 2 APIs that I have chosen are the Google Translate API, and the PayPal API:

### Google Translate API
The user is given the choice at the start of the program to have their prefered language be English or French. When they make their choice, all text from the bot will be in that language, and the bot will also except new responses in that language. If the user changes their mind on a language choice, they can at any time switch back to the other language.

### PayPal API (Returns)
Before when the user wanted a refund for an item they weren't satisfied with or didn't recieve, they were told they would be compesated with credits to their account. Now that system has been implemented. When the user chooses to get a refund, the credits for that item will be added to an account for that user. This account persists for each use of the chatbot, and if the user would like to see their balance, they can at anytime ask the caht bot to show them it.
